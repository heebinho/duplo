# duplo

Simple and straightforward usage of the google drive api to remove duplicates. (identical name/size of files)

I use the the "GoPro Quik" application to import videos/images and sync them automatically to my drive.
The "Delete all" function from GoPro didn't work properly and I ended up with several copies of the same file.
All those copies were happily synced to my drive and used valuable storage.

I was able to free-up 60gb in one run.

Note: Tested and used only for my use-case, so use on your own risk :)

Please let me know ff you know a better way to remove duplicates.
